# WiFi vs Ethernet: Technical Analysis

Why this project uses PoE Ethernet instead of WiFi for the 50-meter birdhouse connection.

## Executive Summary

At 50 meters through trees, WiFi is **not viable**:
- Signal loss: 40-65 dB (trees + distance + weather)
- Seasonal variation: ±25 dB (winter vs summer foliage)
- Reliability: 60-80% uptime vs Ethernet's 99.9%

**Decision**: PoE Ethernet provides power + data in one cable with zero weather dependency.

## Conclusion

The €40-50 premium for PoE equipment over WiFi pays for itself in eliminated troubleshooting within the first month.
